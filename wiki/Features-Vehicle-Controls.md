### Door System

The JayBasics door system aims to be as realistic as possible. One of the ways we do this is restricting which doors you can open while sitting in the car to the ones you realistically would be able to reach.

I've drawn a diagram outlining the doors you can open for each seat of the car your in.

| **Seat Your In** 	| **Doors You Can Access**               	|
|:----------------:	|:--------------------------------------:	|
| Front Driver     	| `Trunk`<br>`Hood`<br>`Front Driver Door` 	|
| Front Passenger  	| `Front Passenger`                        	|
| Rear Driver      	| `Rear Driver`                            	|
| Rear Passenger   	| `Rear Passenger`                         	|

### Window System

Just as with the door system we aim to be as realistic as possible. One of the ways we do this is restricting which windows you can open while sitting in the car to the ones you realistically would be able to interact with.

I've drawn a diagram outlining the windows you can interact with for each seat of the car your in.

| **Seat Your In** 	| **Windows You Can Access**                                                      	|
|:----------------:	|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:	|
| Front Driver     	| `Front Driver Door`<br>`Front Passenger`<br>`Rear Driver`<br>`Rear Passenger` 	|
| Front Passenger  	| `Front Passenger`                                                              	|
| Rear Driver      	| `Rear Driver`                                                                  	|
| Rear Passenger   	| `Rear Passenger`                                                               	|
