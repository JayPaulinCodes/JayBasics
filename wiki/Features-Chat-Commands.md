## Character System

When a player joins the server it will prompt them to set their character's name. This name is used in all of the chat commands.

The character system also adds the [[setname command|Features#commands]]  and the [[name command|Features#commands]]

The [[setname command|Features#commands]] is the command players can use to change their character's name while playing.

The [[name command|Features#commands]] is the command players can use to double check their character's name. It also has an alias which is [[whoami|Features#commands]]
